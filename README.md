Wolf Search Algorithm, An Optimization algorithm based on Swarm Intelligence to find global minima

In optimization search for global minima is crucial, while escaping local minima. 
And a good optimization requires balance between exploration(escape from local minima) and exploitation(approach towards minima).
There is no one perfect algorithm for optimization to find global minima, so here we are taking inpiraton from billions of years of evolution, and trying to mimic from nature to derive a swarm intelligence based optimization.

## Wolf Search Algorithm
This algorithm mimics group characteristic of wolves to find and capture the prey, like ... 
• Social predators, hunt in pack
• Commute as a nuclear family
• Semi-cooperative, move in group in loosely coupled formation
• When hunting, simultaneously search for prey
• Hunting individually, or in a group
• If sign of prey found, howl and call other wolf
• If sign of threats like hunter, run away to a far position
